After having assigned the name we can press enter and leave the following fields empty until we arrive at the console where it gives us the word (yes).

SETP 6
After having reached the word yes we install the jest library with the following code (npm i--save-dave jest).

SETP 7
After having installed the library we create a new file it can be name.spec.js or name.test.js and we make the code that we want to test.
